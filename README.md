# Bourto-Web-Page
Took a while with this one. I like how this design started out. 
I'm learning better how to strutcure and put content on the web page. 
My biggest challenge was learning how to put content and layout it out.
This project taught me how to plan and structure then how to gather content for my web page.
Learning how to have a better process with making personal projects.
