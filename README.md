# Bourto-Web-Page
#Took a while with this one. I like how this design started out. 

#I'm learning better how to strutcure and put content on the web page. 

#My biggest challenge was learning how to put content and layout it out.

#This project taught me how to plan and structure then how to gather content for my web page.

#Learning how to have a better process with making personal projects.
